    <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
    <p>My handle "Verzifier" comes from an old english word for a poet who strung together versers to create poetry. Inputs, commands, coding in it's purist form is an act of mankind expressing ourselves. In a sense code is <span style="font-weight:bold;">art</span> as much as any lyric "versed" by a minstrel.</p>
    <br>
    <pre>&lt;div&gt; A simple divider tag is a doorway to a world of infinite possibilty&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    <br>
    <p>I guess it's all things nerd in me to want to be a programmer and explore this digital frontier.</p>
